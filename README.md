# Quantile-Based-Selection
The QSE and QS procedures are quantile-based sequential procedures (with and without consideration of equivalency
between alternatives) for selecting the best alternative from a set of simulated alternatives. These procedures 
asymptotically guarantee a user-defined target probability of correct selection within a prespecified indifference 
zone. The details of these procedures are presented in a research article accepted to be published in INFORMS Journal 
on Computing (projected publication year is 2020). The Matlab files for each of these procedures are included 
in this repository.
